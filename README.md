# Overwatch League 2020 Analysis

## This notebook provides a preliminary analysis of the data produced from the 2020 Overwatch League season.

## The purpose of this analysis is to show that basic insights can be derived from such data, and that further data analysis is possible.

## Information extracted:

* **Relative player performance** on a number of in-game metrics including: 
  * Highest all damage done
  * Highest all damage taken
  * Highest death count 
  * Highest final blows (the elimination of an enemy)
  * Highest objective kills (eliminations of the enemy on or very near the objective - the payload, capture point)
  * Highest healing done

All of these metrics are based on the "per 10 minutes" statistic recorded in-game. So, for example: highest healing done per 10 minutes.

* **Top played Heroes in each role** (time played, not pick rate):
  *  Most played DPS Heroes 
  *  Most played Support Heroes
  *  Most Played Tank Heroes

* **Adjusted stats by Team** (averaging statistics from all players on each team)
  * Highest damage done
  * Highest damage taken
  * Highest final blows (the elimination of an enemy)
  * Highest objective kills (eliminations of the enemy on or very near the objective - the payload, capture point)
  * Highest healing done 

All of these metrics are based on the "per 10 minutes" statistic recorded in-game. So, for example: highest healing done per 10 minutes.

* **Correlation data plots** (to see if two stats are related to each other): 
  * Deaths vs. Final Blows 
  * Damage vs. Healing Done

All of these metrics are based on the "per 10 minutes" statistic recorded in-game. So, for example: highest healing done per 10 minutes.

* **Pie charts of time played for each character class** (based on time played, and not overall match pick rate): 
  * Most played Damage Heroes by Percentage
  * Most played Support Heroes by Percentage
  * Most played Tank Heroes by Percentage

## Further analysis can show:

* The **correlation of a number of different statistics**, for example: 
  * Healing recieved vs. Damage taken
  * Map played vs. Match length
  * Damage done and death count vs. Healing done

* The **relationship between high/top-performing players** (as well as their role and heroes they play) and the current meta - are these players high-performing only becuase of the current meta, or are they truly great players?
* The **effectiveness of certain team compositions** (in the current meta in OWL)
* The **effectiveness of certain heroes in the current meta** (based on healing done, damage done, eliminations, etc.)
* The **performance of teams on certain maps/map types** (win/loss vs. map played)
* The **performance of teams/players based on match length** - are certain teams losing in matches that are longer than most
* **Hero-based statistical analysis**, for example: 
  * Doomfist with a high final blows/death count ratio
  * Winston with a high elimination/damage taken ratio
